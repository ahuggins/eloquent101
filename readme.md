## About Eloquent 101

This is a base install of Laravel, with some added things in order for people to be able to see how to use Eloquent ORM with actual code and actual data.

## !IMPORTANT About the Web Theme

I used a theme from [HTML5UP](https://html5up.net/) and included the attribution for the theme in this repo. This means you are able to use the theme, locally or comercially under a creative commons license (aka, you must give attribution). If you want, you can go to [Pixelarity](https://pixelarity.com/) and purchase a license allowing you to not have to attribute the theme. Please respect this.

## Get Started

[![Get Started](http://img.youtube.com/vi/YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOUTUBE_VIDEO_ID_HERE "Video Title")

Clone this repo to wherever you want. Needs to be setup similar to any other Laravel project.

1. Once cloned, navigate your terminal to the folder, run `composer install`
2. Update the .env file with your own database credentials
3. Run `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan db:seed`

These last two create the database tables and seed it with the Sakila sample db. This is going to let us use real code to show how Eloquent works and what you can do with it.
