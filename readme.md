## About Eloquent 101

This is a base install of Laravel, with some added things in order for people to be able to see how to use Eloquent ORM with actual code and actual data.

## Get Started

Clone this repo to wherever you want. Needs to be setup similar to any other Laravel project.

Once cloned, navigate your terminal to the folder, run `composer install`, update the .env file with your own database, then run `php artisan migrate` and `php artisan db:seed`. These last two create the database tables and seed it with the Sakila sample db. This is going to let us use real code to show how Eloquent works and what you can do with it.
